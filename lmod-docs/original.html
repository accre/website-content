Lmod is a tool for managing software packages within a shared high-performance computing environment (e.g. the ACCRE cluster). If you started using ACCRE in Winter 2017 or earlier, you can think of Lmod as a replacement for <em>setpkgs</em> and <em>pkginfo</em>. Lmod is designed to intelligently manage, negotiate, and enforce the complex dependencies between software packages and libraries in a HPC environment. This should lead to better usability of administrator-installed software packages and prevent conflicts between lower-level libraries that many packages depend on.

<strong>Starting in Spring 2017, Lmod will be available for testing and general use in parallel with <em>setpkgs</em> and <em>pkginfo</em>. As the ACCRE operating system is <a href=" http://www.accre.vanderbilt.edu/?page_id=3327">upgraded to CentOS 7 in Summer and Fall 2017</a>, only Lmod will be available in the new CentOS 7 environment.</strong>

For instructions on basic Lmod usage, please start with the excellent and concise <a href="http://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/010_user.html">User Guide for Lmod</a>.

A detailed overview of using Lmod on the ACCRE cluster is also available here: <a href="wp-content/uploads/2017/05/from_setpkgs_to_lmod.pdf">Lmod Slide Deck</a>

There are a handful of things you must get accustomed to when transitioning from <em>setpkgs</em>/<em>pkginfo</em> to Lmod:

1. When searching for available packages, Lmod will only show you those packages that were built with a lower-level dependency (most often a compiler) that is already loaded. This means that the first time you run <em>module avail</em> (the equivalent of pkginfo), you will only see a handful of packages available. However, as you load packages via Lmod, additional packages will be listed when you run <em>module avail</em> again. For example:
<pre class="outline">$ module avail

----------------------- Core Modules -----------------------

Use "module spider" to find all possible modules.
Use "module keyword key1 key2 ..." to search for all
possible modules matching any of the "keys".</pre>

possible modules matching any of the "keys".</pre>
Note that additional packages are now listed under the <strong>Applications built with GCC 5.4.0-2.26</strong> section, and can now be loaded with the <em>module load</em> command.

2. Because not all packages are shown by default, you should familiarize yourself with the <em>module spider</em> and <em>module keyword</em> commands in order to check for installed packages. For example, if you want to run R on the cluster:
<pre class="outline">$ module spider R

--------------------------------------------------------
  R:
--------------------------------------------------------
    Description:
      R is a free software environment for statistical
      computing and graphics. - Homepage:
      http://www.r-project.org/

     Versions:
        R/3.2.3

     Other possible modules matches:
        GCCcore  PROJ  Perl  Ruby  Valgrind  cURL  ...

--------------------------------------------------------
  To find other possible module matches do:
      module -r spider '.*R.*'

--------------------------------------------------------
  For detailed information about a specific "R" module (including 
  how to load the modules) use the module's full name.
  For example:

     $ module spider R/3.2.3
--------------------------------------------------------</pre>
Lmod provides a helpful suggestion for the full name of the package, which must include the version, so let's try that:
<pre class="outline">$ module spider R/3.2.3 

--------------------------------------------------------
  R: R/3.2.3
--------------------------------------------------------
    Description:
      R is a free software environment for statistical
      computing and graphics. - Homepage:
      http://www.r-project.org/

     Other possible modules matches:
        GCCcore, PROJ, Perl, Ruby, Valgrind, ...

    You will need to load all module(s) on any one of the 
    lines below before the "R/3.2.3" module is available to load.

      GCC/5.4.0-2.26  OpenMPI/1.10.3
      Intel/2016.3.210-GCC-5.4.0-2.26  IntelMPI/5.1.3.181

    Help:

      computing and graphics. - Homepage: http://www.r-project.org/

--------------------------------------------------------
  To find other possible module matches do:
      module -r spider '.*R/3.2.3.*'</pre>
Excellent! Lmod gives us the exact commands to run before we can load the R/3.2.3 package. Notice you have two options: the GCC-compiled version, or the Intel-compiled version. Either is fine. Intel-compiled packages tend to run a bit faster on our Intel processors, however GCC-compiled software tends to be better supported and more widely tested.

In this case, let's load the GCC-compiled version of R 3.2.3. In order to do this, simply type:
<pre class="outline">$ module load GCC/5.4.0-2.26 OpenMPI/1.10.3 R/3.2.3</pre>
Or (see point 4 below for details on default versions of packages):
<pre class="outline">$ module load GCC OpenMPI R</pre>
To verify that you have the correct version of R loaded type:
<pre class="outline">$ R --version
R version 3.2.3 (2015-12-10) -- "Wooden Christmas-Tree"

The <em>module keyword</em> command is also useful for getting information about available packages. For instance, if you want to see information about MPI versions available on the cluster:
<pre class="outline">$ module keyword MPI

--------------------------------------------------------
The following modules match your search criteria: "MPI"
--------------------------------------------------------

  GCC: GCC/5.4.0-2.26
    The GNU Compiler Collection includes front ends for
    C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java, and Ada, as
    well as libraries for these languages (libstdc++,
    libgcj,...). - Homepage: http://gcc.gnu.org/ 

  Intel: Intel/2016.3.210-GCC-5.4.0-2.26
    Intel Cluster Toolkit Compiler Edition provides
    Intel C,C++ and fortran compilers, Intel MPI and
    Intel MKL - Homepage:
    http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-cluster-toolkit-compiler/

  IntelMPI: IntelMPI/5.1.3.181
    The Intel(R) MPI Library for Linux* OS is a
    multi-fabric message passing library based on ANL
    MPICH2 and OSU MVAPICH2. The Intel MPI Library for
    Linux OS implements the Message Passing Interface,
    version 2 (MPI-2) specification. - Homepage:
    http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mpi-library/

--------------------------------------------------------
To learn more about a package enter:

   $ module spider Foo

where "Foo" is the name of a module

To find detailed information about a particular package you
must enter the version if there is more than one version:

   $ module spider Foo/11.1
--------------------------------------------------------</pre>
The <em>module keyword</em> command ignores case and also supports regular expressions for filtering your searches (the same is true of the <em>module spider</em> command).

3. Lmod supports tab autocompletion, so in order to load a package you can type <em>module load</em> followed by the first few letters of a package name and the &lt;tab&gt; key.

4. In the event that multiple versions of a software package are available, the default version will be noted with a (D). If you exclude the version information (e.g. <em>module load GCC</em>), the default version (or the only version if only a single version exists) of the software will be loaded.

5. Use <em>module list</em> to see what packages are currently loaded in your environment:
<pre class="outline"># module list
No modules loaded

$ module load GCC
$ module list

Currently Loaded Modules:
  1) GCCcore/.5.4.0   3) GCC/5.4.0-2.26
  2) binutils/.2.26</pre>
Notice that more packages than just the GCC module were loaded. This is not unusual, so if you care about the low-level dependencies of your program it's a good idea to run <em>module list</em> to check.

6. Use <em>module unload</em> to remove a package from your environment. For example:
<pre class="outline">$ module load GCC/5.4.0-2.26 
$ module list

Currently Loaded Modules:
  1) GCCcore/.5.4.0   2) binutils/.2.26   3) GCC/5.4.0-2.26

$ module unload GCC/5.4.0-2.26 
$ module list
No modules loaded</pre>
Occasionally (although not in the above example), a package's dependencies will not be removed from your environment after unloading the package via <em>module unload</em>. However, Lmod will remove those dependencies if they cause conflicts in a subsequent <em>module load</em> command.

7. Use <em>module purge</em> to remove all packages from your environment. For example:
<pre class="outline">$ module load GCC/5.4.0-2.26  
$ module load OpenMPI/1.10.3 
$ module list

Currently Loaded Modules:
  1) GCCcore/.5.4.0   3) GCC/5.4.0-2.26    5) hwloc/.1.11.3
  2) binutils/.2.26   4) numactl/.2.0.11   6) OpenMPI/1.10.3

$ module purge
$ module list
No modules loaded</pre>
