# Interacting with the Cluster

Approved Vanderbilt users will be
able to connect to the hostname `bigdata.accre.vanderbilt.edu` with `ssh`.
Users can submit jobs from the command line using the tools maintained 
by Cloudera (e.g. MapReduce, Spark, HBase, etc.).

Cloudera provides the Hadoop User Experience ([Hue](http://gethue.com/)) 
tool to coordinate constructing and executing jobs 
(not to mention browsing and managing HDFS data)
through the interface `bigdata.accre.vanderbilt.edu:8888`.
