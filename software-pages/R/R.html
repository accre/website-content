<p>R is a widely used statistical analysis environment and programming language. Many versions of R are available to use on the cluster. Users typically first develop code interactively on their laptop/desktop, and then run batch processing jobs on the ACCRE cluster through the SLURM job scheduler.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Versions of R on the ACCRE Cluster</h1>
<p>When a user initially logs into the cluster, the system version (R that comes pre-installed on the operating system) is 3.1.0 and is located in /usr/local/bin:</p>

<p>This version of R may be sufficient for simple tasks, but it does not include many of the essential numerical libraries cluster users need. ACCRE administrators have hand-compiled multiple other versions of R that are linked against highly optimized linear algebras like ATLAS and Intel’s MKL, and therefore will in general yield better performance (faster execution time). We encourage users to use the most recent version (3.2.0) installed. This version was built with Intel compilers and linked against Intel’s MKL library, and should therefore yield better performance on ACCRE’s Intel processors.</p>

<p>Multiple other versions of R are available on the cluster but users should use version 3.2.0 unless they have a good reason for not doing so. We can also not guarantee that we will continue supporting older versions of R on the cluster.</p>

<p>Each different version of R has its own packages installed into it, so as you are switching between different versions it is prudent to check the packages that are available. One simple way to do this is by typing <em>installed.packages()</em> from the R command prompt. For example:</p>

<p>Note that the above output has been truncated for brevity. If you were to run this command you would see additional information about installed packages: the path to the package, version, dependencies, license information, and a few other details. To load a package into a R session simply type <code>library(&quot;package\_name&quot;)</code> . For example, to load the parallel package one would need to type:</p>
<pre class="outline"><code>library(&quot;parallel&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="installing-new-packages" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Installing New Packages</h1>
<p>If you find that a particular package you need is missing from the R version you use, you have a few options. If you believe the package will be widely used by other cluster users, you can open a <a href="http://www.accre.vanderbilt.edu/?page_id=369">helpdesk ticket</a> and request that we install the package for cluster-wise access. The other option is to install the package yourself into your home directory. There are multiple ways to install R packages. Below is an example of how you would go about installing a package from the R command prompt. To begin, create a directory in your home directory to install these packages into. In this example, the packages will be installed into a directory at <code>~/R/rlib</code>:</p>
<pre class="outline"><code>[bob@vmps65 ~]$ mkdir -p ~/R/rlib</code></pre>
<p>Now load R and start up an R session from the terminal. In this example we will install the Zelig package.</p>

<p>Zelig appears to load properly, confirming we have successfully installed the package. Note that we first needed to type:</p>
<pre class="outline"><code>&gt; .libPaths(&quot;~/R/rlib&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>in order to point R to the directory where our packages are installed. This command was also need before installing the packages. Alternatively, you may drop this line in your .RProfile if you always want R to see these libraries. Note that these packages were installed for a specific version of R, so it’s unlikely that they will work for a different version.

<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Example Scripts</h1>
<p>Running a R script within a SLURM job is generally straightforward. Unless you are attempting to run one of R’s multi-processing packages, you will want to request a single task, load the appropriate version of R from your SLURM script, and then run your script using the <em>Rscript</em> command. The <em>--no-save</em> flag passed to <em>Rscript</em> prevents R from saving the workspace, which in this example would be relatively large. The following example runs R 3.2.0 on a simple R script that demonstrates the utility of writing vectorized R code:</p>
<pre class="outline"><code>[bob@vmps65 run1]$ ls
R.slurm  vectorize.R</code></pre>
<pre class="outline"><code>[bob@vmps65 run1]$ cat R.slurm 
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --time=00:10:00
#SBATCH --mem=500M
#SBATCH --output=R_job_slurm.out

setpkgs -a R_3.2.0

Rscript --no-save vectorize.R</code></pre>
<pre class="outline"><code>[bob@vmps65 run1]$ cat vectorize.R 
n = 10^7
# populate with random nos
v=runif(n)
system.time({vv&lt;-v*v; m&lt;-mean(vv)}); m
system.time({for(i in 1:length(v)) { vv[i]&lt;-v[i]*v[i] }; m&lt;-mean(vv)}); m</code></pre>
<p>Note this example was taken from a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16902902/why-is-vectorization-faster">Stackoverflow thread</a> . We next submit the job with <em>sbatch</em> :</p>
<pre class="outline"><code>[bob@vmps65 run1]$ sbatch R.slurm 
Submitted batch job 2271536</code></pre>
<p>After waiting a few minutes:</p>
<pre class="outline"><code>[bob@vmps65 run1]$ ls
R_job_slurm.out  R.slurm  vectorize.R</code></pre>
<pre class="outline"><code>[bob@vmps65 run1]$ cat R_job_slurm.out 
   user  system elapsed 
  0.047   0.014   0.062 
[1] 0.3333861
   user  system elapsed 
 20.158   0.058  20.253 
[1] 0.3333861</code></pre>
<p>The elapsed column indicates that the vectorized version of the code executed in 0.062 seconds while the non-vectorized section executed in 20.253 seconds. Both versions produced identical results (0.3333861). Moral of the story: used vectorized code in R scripts whenever possible!</p>
