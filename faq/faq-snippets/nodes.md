###### Jobs: What types of nodes are available?]{#nodes} 

We currently have nodes with
between 8-16 CPU cores and 24-256GB RAM. We also have a group of nodes
equipped with modern NVIDIA GPUs and a small set of nodes with Intel
Xeon Phi accelerators on board. Please refer to our [Intro to the
Cluster slides](http://www.accre.vanderbilt.edu/?page_id=377) for more
