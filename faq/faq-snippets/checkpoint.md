###### Jobs: How do I checkpoint my job? {#checkpoint}

If your job runs more than a few hours, it is
a good idea to periodically save output to disk in case of failure.
There are also tools such as [Berkeley Lab Checkpoint/Restart
(BLCR)](https://ftg.lbl.gov/projects/CheckpointRestart/) that provide
supports for kernel/user level checkpoint/restart.
