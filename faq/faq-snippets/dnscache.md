###### Connectivity: I cannot connect to `login.accre.vanderbilt.edu` or after logging in got an error message says my home directory is not found {#dnscache}

`login.accre.vanderbilt.edu` is a DNS round robin alias for one of our
\~6 cluster gateways. It is possible that the gateway you were randomly
assigned is experiencing a hardware issue. When this happens we take the
gateway out of the rotation but DNS may cache the old information for a
period of time. Please open a help desk ticket for
assistance.
