###### Jobs: How do I run test jobs? {#testcluster}

We allow users to run
very short (&lt; 5 minutes) tests that have low memory usage (&lt; 1
GB). Anything more should be submitted the scheduler. We have a [debug
SLURM
partition/queue](http://www.accre.vanderbilt.edu/?page_id=2154#torque)
available for running quick tests and prototyping.
