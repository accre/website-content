###### Software: How do I run Matlab/SAS job on the cluster? {#matlab_sas_license}

In order to run Matlab/SAS jobs, you must first purchase a
license from [ITS software
store](https://softwarestore.vanderbilt.edu/). Once ITS notifies us your
purchase, you will be added to the relevant group so that you can have
permission to run the software. License may not be shared among
different users. However, with one license, you can run multiple jobs at
the same time on the cluster.
