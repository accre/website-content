###### Disk space: If I need more disk space than this, will you temporarily grant a quota increase? {#tempquota} 

We do not necessarily relax
quota restrictions. It depends entirely on the details of your request
and we can discuss your options. Please submit a [Request
Tracker](/?page_id=369) ticket explaining why you wish a quota change,
how much space you believe you require, and how long you expect to need
it. If you need more diskspace for an extended period of time you may
purchase it. Please see the details of our [cluster disk
policies](/?page_id=67#purchase) then send us your
[request](/?page_id=369).
