###### Software: I'd like to have some software installed on the cluster. How do I go about doing that? {#software_install}

As much as
possible, ACCRE staff are glad to accommodate your needs for software.
Of course, the software must be amenable to execution in the cluster
environment and (if not open source) you are responsible for taking care
of licensing arrangements prior to installation, as well as continued
maintenance of the software license. If you'd like to explore the
possibility of adding some software to our cluster environment, please
submit a [Request Tracker](/?page_id=369) ticket. Note that we in
general recommend that users install software into their cluster home
directories. In this way you have complete control over the version of
the software, applying updates, and so on. ACCRE staff are more than
happy to assist you during this process.
