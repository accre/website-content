###### Connectivity: How can I make a scheduled downtime work for me?{#down_time}

As a scheduled downtime for the cluster approaches more time
becomes available for shorter jobs. Thus, if you have applications that
take a few days or less to run, you will be able to execute more of
these types of jobs as a scheduled downtime approaches because
applications requiring longer period of times will not be running. It's
an excellent time to take advantage of the extra computing cycles that
would ordinarily not be available!
