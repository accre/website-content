###### Jobs: What is the maximum number of jobs I can submit or have running at any one time? {#maxjoblimits}

**"Active" Limits:** Each
user/group/account has a limit on the number of processors in use at any
time. This number is summed from any combination of single and
multi-processor jobs. Additional limits are placed as necessary for
groups running either medium (defined as 4 to 7 days) or long (over 7
days) jobs on a regular basis if there usage is impacting the ability of
other groups to use their full fairshare. Individual groups may also
request upper limits on their users. New guest users have upper job
limits until they have attended the [Introduction to the Cluster and Job
Scheduler classes](/?page_id=377). Use the
[`showLimits`](http://www.accre.vanderbilt.edu/?page_id=2154#showLimits)
command to check your group's limits. Please refer to the [job scheduler
policies](/?page_id=89) for additional important details of these
limits.
