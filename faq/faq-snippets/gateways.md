###### Jobs: Can I run on the gateway machines? {#gateways}

When you log
on via `login.accre.vanderbilt.edu`, you are logged onto a gateway
machine. From here you submit your jobs which are sent to the compute
nodes by the scheduler. However, we do allow you to run very short, &lt;
5 minute, test jobs on the gateway machines, as long as such jobs do not
slow the gateway for other users. Anything longer than this should be
submitted to the compute nodes using `batch` (see [How to Submit
Basic Jobs](/?page_id=343)).
